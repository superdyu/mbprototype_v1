// ─── Emergency fund — the three capture screens ──────────────────────────────
// TAB: Goals (sub-screen) | NAV BAR: Hidden — full-bleed
//
// One screen id, three steps on state.esf.step, the same shape as the budget
// builder next door: a screen costs five wiring points and each is a place to
// forget, so three steps of one screen cost them once.
//
// ── TYPED FIGURES ONLY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// No sliders and no steppers. The builder next door is all sliders, deliberately
// so; here it is deliberately the opposite. A slider gets you close and not
// precise, and these are survival figures where the real number matters — and
// with two fields sharing a box there is no room for a stepper pair anyway.
//
// Number entry rides the SIMULATED KEYBOARD that already exists
// (components/keyboard.js): `inputmode="numeric"` is what selects its pad
// layer, and that pad already carries a Done key which commits the field and
// closes it. Nothing here needs to build a submit control.
//
// ── WATCH THE KEYBOARD LATCH ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Closing the pad removes 250px of layout, which pulls a button out from under
// a finger mid-press so no click is ever dispatched. kbdInit holds the close
// while a press is in flight. Any new control below the fields inherits that
// problem; do not work around it locally.

// ── ONE HEADER, EVERY STEP ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The per-step titles are gone on the owner's call. They named the step rather
// than the feature, so a tester three screens in had been told what KIND of
// number to expect but never what they were building or why. The progress pips
// carry the position; the header carries the point.
const ESF_TITLE_MAIN = "Emergency Savings Fund";

// Owner-supplied art (L22), one scene per step, matched to what that step asks
// about: the house and cars where rent and a car payment are collected, the
// living room where the phone and internet bills are.
//
// Not generated — D10 forbids that and it holds. A step with no entry here
// simply shows no banner, which is the right degradation: a missing image must
// never leave a gap where a picture was promised.
// These two are WIDE (roughly 2.36:1), authored for this banner rather than
// borrowed from elsewhere, so `cover` barely crops them — unlike the square-ish
// yard illustration the Home screen uses.
// `ratio` is the art's own aspect. The first two were drawn wide for this slot;
// the living-expenses and safe illustrations are near-square, so a shared fixed
// ratio would crop a third off one pair or letterbox the other. Each image
// brings its own.
// `maxH` is what keeps every screen off the scrollbar. The art's own aspect
// decides the shape; this decides how much vertical budget that step can spare
// for it, and it varies because the steps do not carry the same load. A 2.36
// image at frame width is naturally ~136px and needs no cap; a 1.79 one is
// ~180px and gets trimmed on the screens that cannot afford it.
