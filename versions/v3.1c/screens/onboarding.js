// ── v3.1: WHY THE GOAL QUESTION IS SECOND ────────────────────────────────────
// It used to be sixth, which asked for a ZIP, a household size and an income
// band before the tester had any stake in the app. Asking what they want to
// improve first gives them a reason to answer the other three. It also means
// onbPrimaryGoal() — which picks one of five intro-film scripts — is settled
// five steps before the film plays, rather than one.
//
// ── v3.1: HOW TWO STEPS WERE REMOVED ─────────────────────────────────────────
// By taking their keys OUT OF THIS ARRAY, and nothing else. The housing/commute
// pair ("lifestyle") and the trial pitch ("trial") still have their renderers,
// their handlers and their copy exactly where they were, a few hundred lines
// down — unreachable, because no step is keyed to them.
//
// That is deliberate, and it is not laziness: this is a prototype under
// iteration, deleting them would orphan a dozen helpers into DEAD_BASELINE
// (onbCommuteDetail, onbSetLifestyle, onbTransportMonthly, ONB_CAR_CLASSES and
// the rest), and putting a step back is a one-word edit this way. Do not
// "clean up" the branches below on the grounds that nothing reaches them.
// Two step lists, chosen by the ESF_ONLY flag in js/config.js (which loads
// first). The full list is the v3.1 onboarding plus the three questions the
// emergency fund needs; the ESF list is only what the fund reads, in the order
// the ESF spec asks it. Nothing is deleted either way — a step outside the
// active list keeps its renderer and simply isn't walked.

// ZIP, income, miles. Owner, 2026-09-29: "dont think the who lives with you,
// what kind of place do you live in screens are needed" — reversing the day
// before's five. Income stays because peers are an income band in a place.
// Peers without a household answer read the model's single-person column,
// so the finder's peer line no longer names a household size.
//
// History, superseded — owner, 2026-09-26: "remove these onboarding screens
// from this build." The
// household, home-type, coverage and income steps belong to the emergency fund;
// they were being walked through on the way to a calculator that reads neither.
// What is left is what this feature actually uses: the ZIP (state tax, fees,
// insurance, fuel prices) and how far they drive (fuel and upkeep).
//
// Somebody who starts an emergency fund from here therefore arrives without the
// answers the ESF would have collected. That is survivable — every ESF model
// falls back (household → adults at a middling age, place → null, coverage →
// null) — and it is the price of not making a car buyer answer questions about
