// Spec: docs/emergency-fund-spec.md, as amended by the owner during the
// reconciliation pass. Where the two disagree, the amendments win and say so.
//
// ── SIX CATEGORIES, NOT A NEW TAXONOMY ───────────────────────────────────────
// The spec names seven "categories" of its own. They are NOT a second taxonomy:
// six of them are a VIEW over CATEGORIES (js/taxonomy.js) and the seventh —
// Buffer — turned out not to be a category at all but a percentage on the
// total. Every lookup below keys on the bare 12-category strings, because those
// strings are the join key across peer-benchmarks, seed-state, monthToDateActuals
// and the help-me-out trees. A parallel set of keys here would be a second join
// key, which is the single most expensive mistake available in this codebase.
//
// The six the owner excluded — Dining out, Subscriptions, Personal care,
// Entertainment, Shopping, Other — are dispensable in an emergency by
// definition, so they are not asked about and not carried. They still exist in
// the budget; see esfToBaseline().
//
// ── ROWS ARE SMALLER THAN CATEGORIES ─────────────────────────────────────────
// Screens are grouped by how hard a number is to RECALL, not by what it belongs
// to, so two categories split across screens: Transport becomes a car payment
// (typed, screen 1) and running costs (estimated, screen 3); Utilities becomes
// the locally-priced part and the nationally-priced part. esfRowsForCategory()
// is the seam back.

// `group` is what shares a card. Two rows with the same group sit side by side
// in one box; a group of one gets its own. That is how "Rent | Mortgage" and
// "Car Payments | Public Transportation" become single questions with two
// answers rather than four separate cards.

// nothing, and their target is quietly short.
