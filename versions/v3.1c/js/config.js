//   false → onboarding runs → streak shows 1  (PERSONA.state.streakDaysIfOnboarded)

// TEMPORARY SCAFFOLDING — the "Skip all setup" profile picker.
//
// Skipping used to be silent: every write in onbFinish() is guarded, so a
// skipped field fell through to the persona and the tester spent the session as
// Sam from Los Angeles without being told. The picker asks two questions and
// names the figures they are about to see.
//
//   true  -> "Skip all setup" opens the picker (screens/profile-picker.js)
//   false -> skip applies profileDefault() silently; the screen is never routed
//
// Same rule as SKIP_ONBOARDING: flipping it must not require unwinding anything
// else. The nine profiles survive either way — the skip fallback and
// scripts/sweep.js's test matrix both read them.
//
// SKIP_ONBOARDING deliberately does NOT show the picker even when this is true.
// That flag exists to reach Home fast; stopping it for two questions defeats
// the one thing it is for. Two skip paths, two intents.

//
//   true  -> onboarding asks only what the emergency fund reads, then opens it;
//            the app shows Goals and the fund and nothing else
//   false -> the full app, exactly as it was
//
// Hides, never deletes. Every other screen, renderer and step is still in the
// code and still routed for the admin jump list; this only takes them out of
// what a tester walks through. Same rule as the two flags above: flipping it
// must not require unwinding anything else.

// BIG PURCHASE ENTRY — v3.1 (C) only.
//
//   true  -> onboarding hands over to the Big Purchase Calculator instead of
//            the emergency fund. The fund is still one tap away: the
//            calculator's own "Do you have an emergency fund?" check opens it
//   false -> onboarding opens the emergency fund, exactly as v3.1 (B) does
//
// Sits on top of ESF_ONLY rather than replacing it: onboarding still asks the
// fund's questions (ZIP, household, miles…), which the calculator reads too.
// The Goals tab carries an "Estimate a big purchase" card either way.
