// It used to be sixth, which asked for a ZIP, a household size and an income
// band before the tester had any stake in the app. Asking what they want to
// improve first gives them a reason to answer the other three. It also means
// onbPrimaryGoal() — which picks one of five intro-film scripts — is settled
// five steps before the film plays, rather than one.
//
// ── v3.1: HOW TWO STEPS WERE REMOVED ─────────────────────────────────────────
// By taking their keys OUT OF THIS ARRAY, and nothing else. The housing/commute
// pair ("lifestyle") and the trial pitch ("trial") still have their renderers,
// their handlers and their copy exactly where they were, a few hundred lines
// down — unreachable, because no step is keyed to them.
//
// That is deliberate, and it is not laziness: this is a prototype under
// iteration, deleting them would orphan a dozen helpers into DEAD_BASELINE
// (onbCommuteDetail, onbSetLifestyle, onbTransportMonthly, ONB_CAR_CLASSES and
// the rest), and putting a step back is a one-word edit this way. Do not
// "clean up" the branches below on the grounds that nothing reaches them.

//
