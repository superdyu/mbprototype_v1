// ─── Budget builder — three steps, and a Help me out toggle per line ─────────
// TAB: Budget (sub-screen) | NAV BAR: Hidden — full-bleed
//
// Replaces v3.1's single twelve-slider `spendingProfile` screen, and with it
// the six lifestyle questions and the "Which is closer?" reconciliation that
// followed. Those asked everyone the same six questions whether or not they
// needed them; this asks nothing unless the tester says they cannot estimate a
// line, and then asks only about that line.
//
// ── ONE SCREEN, THREE STEPS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The step index lives on state.budgetBuild rather than in three screen ids.
// A screen here costs five wiring points (render.js x4, utils.js, state.js) and
// each one is a place to forget; three steps of one screen cost them once.
//
// ── EVERY LINE IS A SLIDER ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The steps group categories by how well a tester knows them, NOT by how the
// figure is entered. That distinction was misread once and built as a number
// field on step 1; it is not one. Rent is a figure you can state, which is why
// it opens on a good default and needs less dragging — not why it would need a
// keyboard.
//
// The thumb opens on the PEER figure for this profile, so it starts dead centre
// of the band drawn behind it and any move away from it is deliberate.
