// ─── Budget band — the stylised box-and-whiskers track ───────────────────────
//
// One horizontal track carrying, at most, four marks:
//
//   the peer BAND     where households like you land — the peer figure +/-10%
//   the peer MEDIAN   a tick at the peer figure itself
//   the BUDGET        what you planned
//   the DOT           what you have actually spent (view), or what you are
//                     setting (build, where the dot is the slider thumb)
//
// It replaces the three stacked Budget / Peers / You bars everywhere they were
// rendered. Three bars state three numbers and leave the reader to do the
// arithmetic; one track puts them in a spatial relationship, which is the
// comparison the screen is actually for.
//
// ── HAND-ROLLED, IN CSS PERCENTAGES, NOT SVG ────────────────────────────────
// L1 rules out chart libraries, so this is built by hand like every other
// visualisation here (thermometer, badge-ring, renderMPTrend). It is the one
// that is NOT SVG, deliberately: a band track is a one-dimensional layout, and
// `left: %` inside a fluid container is exactly that, at any width, with the
// dot staying circular. An SVG would need either a fixed viewBox (wrong at
// 390px) or preserveAspectRatio="none" (which flattens the dot into an
// ellipse).
//
// ── THE SCALE IS FULL-MONTH, AND THAT IS A CHOICE ───────────────────────────
// Budget, peers and spend are all monthly figures, and spend-to-date is
// compared against them as-is. Early in the month that flatters the tester --
// five days in, nobody is over. The owner's call, for now: pro-rating is built
// (see bandScale) and switched off, so turning it on later is one constant.

// The owner's peer spread. Not researched dispersion -- a stated +/-10% around
// the modelled peer figure, so the band means "about what peers like you
// spend", never "the middle 50% of a real distribution". The copy on every
// surface has to stay inside that claim.
const BAND_PEER_SPREAD = 0.10;

// The 10% of breathing room past the largest mark, so nothing sits welded to
// the right edge.
const BAND_HEADROOM = 1.1;

// ── The pro-rate switch ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Off: every figure is a full month and spend-to-date is compared against it.
// On:  the peer band and the budget mark scale to how far into the month we
//      are, so all three are "so far this month".
//
// Spend is NEVER scaled either way -- it is already a to-date figure, and
// scaling it would be counting the month twice.

/**
 * Everything the track needs, as numbers. Pure -- no DOM, no state reads --
 * so the geometry can be asserted in a harness without stubbing a browser.
 *
 *   budget   the plan figure
 *   actual   spend to date (view mode only; 0 in build)
 *   peer     the modelled peer figure, or null when there isn't one
 *   hi       the track's right edge. Supply it in BUILD mode; omit it and the
 *            owner's view rule applies.
 *
 * ── THE RIGHT EDGE FITS EVERYTHING ON THE TRACK ─────────────────────────────
 * hi is 1.1 x the largest mark -- budget, spend, or the TOP OF THE PEER BAND.
 * Peers are in that max, so every mark is always visible with a tenth of the
 * track as breathing room past the highest one.
 *
 * This was briefly the other way round, with peers excluded so that a band
 * sitting above everything else would run off the edge and be marked. Against
 * the seeded persona that fired on five of twelve categories -- LA prices
 * against a modest budget -- so the chart drew nothing at all on nearly half
 * its rows. "Peers spend far more than you planned" is better said by a band
 * sitting hard right of the budget mark than by an empty track and a rule.
 *
 * ── WHY BUILD MODE STILL SUPPLIES ITS OWN ───────────────────────────────────
 * There the budget IS the value being dragged, so an edge computed from the
 * marks would move under the thumb -- the recoil that budgetSliderMax() was
 * written to kill (screens/budget-v3.js). Build passes that stable ceiling
 * instead. It is always well clear of the peer band (budgetSliderMax is at
 * least 2.2x the peer figure, against a band top of 1.1x), so peers stay on
 * screen there too -- a slider also needs somewhere to drag TO, which an edge
 * pinned to the current marks would not leave.
