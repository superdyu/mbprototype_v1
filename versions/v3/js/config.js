//
// Skipping used to be silent: every write in onbFinish() is guarded, so a
// skipped field fell through to the persona and the tester spent the session as
// Sam from Los Angeles without being told. The picker asks two questions and
// names the figures they are about to see.
//
//   true  -> "Skip all setup" opens the picker (screens/profile-picker.js)
//   false -> skip applies profileDefault() silently; the screen is never routed
//
// Same rule as SKIP_ONBOARDING: flipping it must not require unwinding anything
// else. The nine profiles survive either way — the skip fallback and
// scripts/sweep.js's test matrix both read them.
//
// SKIP_ONBOARDING deliberately does NOT show the picker even when this is true.
// That flag exists to reach Home fast; stopping it for two questions defeats
// the one thing it is for. Two skip paths, two intents.
