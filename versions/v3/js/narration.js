// ─── Narration seam — one place that decides how a line gets spoken ──────────
//
// L10 says Web Speech is a BUILD-TIME generator and runtime plays .wav. That
// holds for the full build and is still the preferred path: when a generated
// .wav exists, callers play it and never come here.
//
// But scripts/gen-audio.sh needs macOS `say`, and the prototype is being built
// and demoed on a PC where no TTS exists at all — so on that machine every
// narrated surface is silent, and "is there a voice in the video" cannot be
// prototyped at all. Owner's call: fall back to runtime speech so the voice is
// there on any machine. The .wav still wins wherever it has been generated, so
// nothing regresses on the Mac and the production pipeline is unchanged.
//
// Order of preference, per surface:
//   1. generated .wav   (L10, best quality, measured timings)
//   2. runtime speech   (this file — any machine, no build step)
//   3. word-count clock (silent, captions still advance)
//
// ── THE CANCEL TRAP ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// speechSynthesis.cancel() does NOT drop the cancelled utterance's callback —
// it QUEUES onend (or onerror). A caller that cancels and immediately starts
// the next line will get the OLD line's onend afterwards, and if that advances
// a playlist it starts a second loop that eats the script. Every utterance here
// therefore captures a generation, and a callback whose generation is stale is
// dropped. Callers never have to know.
