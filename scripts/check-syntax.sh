# JS syntax checker — the automated gate for this repo.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: this repo gets worked on from more than one machine, and the
# two do not agree on which JS engine exists. The Mac has no node but ships
# JavaScriptCore (`jsc`, which exposes checkSyntax()); the Linux/WSL box has node
# (often only under ~/.nvm, off PATH for non-interactive shells) and no jsc.
# Hardcoding either one makes the repo's only automated gate fail outright on the
# other machine, which is exactly what happened. So: use whichever is present.
# Both were verified with a positive and a negative control — each correctly
# rejects `function broken( {` and correctly accepts valid source.
#
# NOTE: jsc's checkSyntax() takes a FILE PATH, not source text. Passing source
# makes it fail with "Could not open file", which looks like a syntax error and
# isn't.
#
#   bash scripts/check-syntax.sh                 # all JS under versions/v3 + gate
#   bash scripts/check-syntax.sh path/to/file.js # specific files
#   bash scripts/check-syntax.sh versions/v3     # everything under a directory
#
# Exits non-zero if anything fails to parse.
