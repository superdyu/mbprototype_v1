"""
Generates versions/<MB_VERSION>/data/zip-cost-of-living.json (default v3.1).

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The output is ~450KB of derived numbers covering every ZIP code in the country.
Without the generator beside it, nobody can audit where any single figure came
from. This file IS the audit trail.

It is a DATA AUTHORING TOOL, not a build step. Nothing about opening index.html
depends on it having been run — run it by hand when refreshing the sources, then
run scripts/wrap-data.sh to regenerate the .js wrapper.

    python3 scripts/build-cost-of-living.py

WHAT IT REPLACED
----------------
The app used to resolve a ZIP through a 3-digit prefix to one of four
cost-of-living tiers (peer-benchmarks.json colTiers). Three things were wrong
with that, and they compounded:

  1. Every ZIP sharing a prefix-tier was identical. Manhattan, Palo Alto, Santa
     Clara and Los Angeles all resolved to the same "very_high" figures.
  2. That tier caps Housing at 1.85, so nowhere in America could read higher.
  3. The headline index averaged all twelve categories unweighted, so Housing —
     the only category that really swings — was one twelfth of it.

Net effect: Santa Clara read 121% of national and Rogers, Arkansas read 111%.
BEA says 112.9 and 91.0, with housing at 213.0 against 75.8.

SOURCES (all public, no API key)
--------------------------------
  BEA Regional Price Parities, 2023 — the US government's own cost-of-living
      index by place, 100 = national. Published per metro area plus a
      metro/nonmetro portion for each state, broken into All items, Goods,
      Services: Housing, Services: Utilities and Services: Other.
  Zillow ZORI  — typical observed RENT by county. The right basis for a
      monthly-spend model; covers ~1,390 counties.
  Zillow ZHVI  — typical home VALUE by county. Housing fallback where ZORI has
      no coverage; ~3,070 counties. Also supplies the county -> metro mapping
      that joins counties to BEA geographies.
  EIA          — average residential electricity price by state, cents/kWh.
  scpike/us-state-county-zip — ZIP -> county, US Census derived.

Figures are prototype-grade (D19): editable, not a live feed, not advice.
