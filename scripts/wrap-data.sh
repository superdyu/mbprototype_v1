# Generates versions/v3/data/*.js from the sibling *.json files.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (L13, architecture.md §1): the app is opened as a file:// page
# with no dev server, and browsers block fetch()/XHR against local files. So the
# spec's JSON cannot be loaded over the network — it ships wrapped in a plain
# `const NAME = {...};` assignment and loads via a <script> tag like every other
# file in the app.
#
# The .json files stay byte-identical to v3 Files/spec/data/ so drift from the
# spec is always one `diff -rq` away. The .js files are GENERATED — never
# hand-edit them; edit nothing, or edit the .json and re-run this.
#
#   bash scripts/wrap-data.sh
#
# Run it after changing any data file. Nothing about opening index.html depends
# on it having been run recently — it is not a build step in the npm sense.
