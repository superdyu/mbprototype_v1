#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Generates narration audio for the daily update, and extracts its timings.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (L10): the spec assumes live Web Speech playback, where
# `boundary` events populate timings at runtime. We play a pre-generated .wav
# instead, and boundary events do not fire for recorded audio — so timings must
# be extracted here, once, and written back. That is exactly the production
# pipeline D29 describes:
#
#     script text → TTS → timing extraction → timings written back → visuals resync
#
# macOS `say` is offline, keyless, and the same voice family Safari's Web Speech
# exposes, so D04's intent (browser-native, no third-party keys, no ElevenLabs)
# holds even though its "no build-time audio assets" clause does not.
#
# ONE FILE PER SEGMENT. Each file's duration IS that segment's timing, and a
# single segment can be re-cut without redoing the whole script.
#
# OUTPUT
#   versions/v3/assets/audio/daily/<scriptId>/<segmentId>.wav
#   versions/v3/data/daily-timings.js     generated, loaded by the player
#   versions/v3/assets/audio/onboarding/onboarding_intro/<segmentId>.wav
#
# The onboarding intro is generated the same way but needs no timings: its
# player advances on the audio element's `ended` event rather than a timing
# table. Until this script has been run on a Mac those .wav files are absent,
# and the onboarding player falls back to a word-count clock — captions still
# advance, there is just no voice.
#
# The timings are written to a SEPARATE generated file, not back into
# daily-scripts.json — that stays a byte-identical copy of the spec so drift is
# always one `diff -rq` away (L13). The player prefers the generated timings,
# falls back to the spec's static block, then to a 165 wpm estimate.
#
#   bash scripts/gen-audio.sh
#
# Re-running is safe and idempotent.
